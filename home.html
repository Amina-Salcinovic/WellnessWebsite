<h1>Welcome to our Wellness Center</h1>
<h4>A Residential Retreat For Your Mind, Body and Soul</h4>
<p>    
     At our Wellness Center, we know that wellness is more than just being physically well, it means taking care of yourself holistically. Join us in your adventure to health, peace of mind and healing, whether you are 
     looking to unwind, recharge or transform. 
</p>
<p>
Together, we assist you on your journey to do less and feel more, with the ways in which you can use them as part of your life: stress relief; movement; healthy food choices; and using mindfulness to clear up your mind.
